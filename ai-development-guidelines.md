# AI-Assisted Development: Human-in-the-Loop Guidelines

## Executive Summary

This document establishes comprehensive guidelines for integrating AI code assistants (claude.code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) into software development workflows while maintaining critical human oversight and quality control.

## 1. Development Workflow Requirements

### 1.1 Pre-Development Phase

**AI Usage Declaration**
- Engineers must declare AI assistant usage in commit messages using standardized tags:
  - `[AI-ASSISTED]` - AI helped with implementation
  - `[AI-GENERATED]` - Majority of code generated by AI
  - `[AI-REVIEWED]` - AI used for code review suggestions

**Human Validation Checkpoints**
- **Requirement Analysis**: Human must validate AI's understanding of requirements before implementation
- **Architecture Review**: Senior engineer approval required for AI-suggested architectural decisions
- **Security Impact Assessment**: Human security review mandatory for any AI-generated code touching:
  - Authentication/authorization
  - Data validation
  - External APIs
  - Database operations

### 1.2 Development Phase Guardrails

**Code Generation Rules**
1. **Maximum AI Block Size**: No single AI-generated code block exceeds 50 lines without human review
2. **Critical Path Restriction**: AI cannot generate code for:
   - Payment processing
   - User authentication
   - Data encryption/decryption
   - Database migration scripts
   - Production deployment scripts

**Human Oversight Requirements**
- **Line-by-Line Review**: Engineer must understand and validate every line of AI-generated code
- **Test Coverage**: Human-written tests required for all AI-generated functions
- **Documentation**: Human must write/verify all documentation for AI-assisted code

## 2. Pull Request (PR) Review Process

### 2.1 Enhanced PR Template

```markdown
## AI Assistant Usage
- [ ] AI assistant used (specify which: claude.code, Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] Code blocks generated by AI are clearly marked
- [ ] All AI-generated code has been human-reviewed and understood
- [ ] Tests written/reviewed by human for AI-generated code

## Human Validation Checklist
- [ ] Requirements correctly interpreted
- [ ] Architecture patterns followed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Edge cases covered

## AI-Generated Code Blocks
List specific files/functions/classes that were AI-generated:
- File: `src/utils/helper.js`, Lines: 15-45, AI: claude.code
- Function: `validateUserInput()`, AI: GitHub Copilot
```

### 2.2 Review Assignment Rules

**Mandatory Human Reviewers**
- **AI-Generated PRs**: Minimum 2 human reviewers (1 senior engineer)
- **Critical System Changes**: Lead architect must review any AI-assisted changes to:
  - Core business logic
  - Security-sensitive components
  - Performance-critical paths
  - Integration points

**Review Focus Areas**
1. **Logic Validation**: Verify AI understood requirements correctly
2. **Security Analysis**: Check for common AI-generated security vulnerabilities
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure adherence to team coding standards
4. **Test Coverage**: Validate test completeness and quality

## 3. Technical Implementation Requirements

### 3.1 Code Quality Gates

**Pre-Commit Hooks**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# AI-assisted code quality check
if grep -r "\[AI-GENERATED\]" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" .; then
    echo "AI-generated code detected. Running enhanced checks..."
    
    # Enhanced linting for AI code
    eslint --config .eslintrc.ai-strict.js src/
    
    # Security scan
    npm audit --audit-level moderate
    
    # Test coverage check
    npm run test:coverage -- --threshold=90
fi
```

**CI/CD Pipeline Modifications**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-assisted-review.yml
name: AI-Assisted Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  ai-code-analysis:
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.body, 'AI assistant used')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Enhanced Security Scan
        run: |
          # Run additional security tools for AI-generated code
          bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json
          semgrep --config=auto --json --output=semgrep-report.json
      
      - name: Code Complexity Analysis
        run: |
          # Check for overly complex AI-generated functions
          radon cc . --min=B --show-complexity
      
      - name: Dependency Vulnerability Check
        run: |
          # Enhanced dependency checking
          safety check --json --output safety-report.json
```

### 3.2 Monitoring and Metrics

**AI Usage Tracking**
```javascript
// Development metrics collection
const aiUsageMetrics = {
  trackAIAssistance: (file, linesOfCode, aiTool, timestamp) => {
    // Log AI usage for analysis
    metrics.increment('ai.code.generated', {
      tool: aiTool,
      fileType: path.extname(file),
      size: linesOfCode
    });
  },
  
  trackHumanReview: (file, reviewTime, issuesFound) => {
    // Track human review effectiveness
    metrics.histogram('ai.code.review_time', reviewTime, {
      file: file,
      issues: issuesFound
    });
  }
};
```

## 4. Quality Control Framework

### 4.1 Testing Requirements

**AI-Generated Code Testing**
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 95% for AI-generated functions
- **Integration Tests**: Required for all AI-generated API endpoints
- **Edge Case Testing**: Human must identify and test edge cases AI might miss

**Test Review Process**
```javascript
// Example test validation for AI-generated code
describe('AI-Generated Function: calculateUserScore()', () => {
  // Human-written tests for AI-generated function
  
  it('should handle null user input gracefully', () => {
    // Test case AI might not consider
    expect(calculateUserScore(null)).toBe(0);
  });
  
  it('should prevent integer overflow for large scores', () => {
    // Security-focused test case
    expect(calculateUserScore(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)).toBeLessThan(1000);
  });
  
  it('should validate input types correctly', () => {
    // Input validation test
    expect(() => calculateUserScore('invalid')).toThrow('Invalid input type');
  });
});
```
